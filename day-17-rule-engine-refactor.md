# Day 17 — Refactoring into a Rule Engine

## What changed today

- Broke monolithic script into functions
- Separated counting from rule evaluation
- Separated rule evaluation from report formatting

## What clicked

I can now see the difference between scripting and architecture.
The code is easier to reason about.

## What I want to refine next

Add more rule types (not just min_count).
