# Day 10 – Dictionaries for Readable Outputs

## What changed
- Replaced positional list outputs with a dictionary
- Outputs are now labeled and self-explanatory

## Why this is better
- Order no longer matters
- Easier to extend scripts safely
- Matches how APIs return structured data

## Connection to ACC / APS
- API responses are usually key–value based
- Dictionaries map naturally to JSON

## What clicked today
- Using dictionaries removes the need to remember output order and makes results self-explanatory.

## What I need more practice with
- Structuring nested dictionaries for more detailed results.
