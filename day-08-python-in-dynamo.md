# Day 8 – First Python Inside Dynamo

## What I did
- Used a Python Script node in Dynamo
- Passed a list of Revit elements into Python
- Returned a count back to Dynamo

## Key realization
Python in Dynamo feels like:
- Explicit version of what Dynamo already does implicitly

## What surprised me
- The unfamiliar part was explicitly managing inputs and outputs instead of relying on Dynamo’s visual wiring.

## What still feels unfamiliar
- Using IN and OUT explicitly
