# Day 13 – Severity Levels & Rule-Based QA

## What changed
- Introduced severity levels (info, warning, error)
- Replaced generic warnings with structured issues

## Why this matters
- Makes reports actionable instead of descriptive
- Enables filtering, alerting, and automation

## Connection to ACC / APS
- QA systems rely on severity-based issues
- This structure maps cleanly to issue APIs

## What feels solid now
- Designing outputs that can be filtered and acted on by downstream systems.

## What I want to refine next
- Aligning these rules with how ACC / APS issue workflows are modeled.
