# AEC Computer Science Foundations

## Why this exists
I work in AEC tech sales and want to become deeply technical in:
- Programming fundamentals
- BIM automation
- Revit / Civil 3D / ACC / APS APIs

This repo documents my learning journey from zero formal CS background
to being able to reason about and build real automation.

## My 90-day goal
- Understand how code works (not just copy-paste)
- Be able to read, modify, and reason about Revit / ACC / APS API code
- Build practical AEC automation tools

## Day 1 – Setup & Intent
- Created GitHub account
- Installed GitHub Desktop
- Created first repository
- Wrote this README

## Rules for myself
- Commit something every day (even notes)
- Learning > perfection
- Messy is allowed
