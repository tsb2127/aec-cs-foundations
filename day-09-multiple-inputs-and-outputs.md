# Day 9 – Multiple Inputs and Outputs

## What I did
- Passed two Dynamo inputs into Python
- Counted two different element sets
- Returned a list of results

## Key realization
- Python outputs structured data, not just single values
- Lists are the common language between Dynamo and code

## Connection to future APIs
- API calls often return collections
- Results usually need unpacking and interpretation

## What felt easier today
- Working with lists as inputs and outputs felt familiar because it mirrors how Dynamo already structures data.

## What still requires thought
- I’m still building intuition for when to return a list versus a more structured format.
